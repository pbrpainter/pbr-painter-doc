                <h1 id="old-pbr-painter-tutorials">Old PBR Painter Tutorials</h1>
<p>This page contains all of the old tutorials for PBR Painter 2. These are not listed on YouTube but can still be accessed directly through the links below, should you find 
them useful!</p>
<h1 id="pbr-painter-24">PBR Painter 2.4</h1>
<p>PBR Painter 2.4 was the final version in the PBR Painter 2 series! Check out everything that was added in this version:</p>

<h2 id="installation-and-loading-the-pbr-painter-workspace">Installation and Loading the PBR Painter Workspace</h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mAGIwUKqm5E" title="YouTube video player" 
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<p>When you purchase PBR Painter, you will have access to the .zip file that contains the entire addon package. </p>
<p>This can be installed in Blender using the normal approach:
<img alt="Screenshot" src="img/installation.gif" /></p>
<h2 id="updating-to-new-versions">Updating to New Versions</h2>
<p>If you already have an old version of PBR Painter installed, and wish to update to a new version, please follow the following steps:</p>
<p><li> 1. Completely uninstall the old version from Blender. </li>
<li> 2. Close and restart Blender to ensure any cached files are cleared. </li>
<li> 3. Install the new version as per normal. </li></p>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-asset-browser-blender-3x-and-4x-only">Setting up the Asset Browser (Blender 3.x and 4.x Only)</h2>

</p>

<p>If you are using Blender 3, it is recommended that you choose an asset directory, within the addon preferences. This will create a new filepath to tell Blender where
you're PBR Painter assets will be stored.</p>
<h1 id="overview-of-the-main-ui">Overview of the Main UI</h1>
<p> 
Everythign you need to know about the main UI and panels in PBR Painter is explained here:

</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-layered-texturing">Introduction to Layered Texturing</h1>
<p>PBR Painter uses a layer-based system to allow you to build complex and realistic looking materials. While the details behind this system are complex, the general
concepts are easy to understand and intuitive. This part of the documentation is focused on explaining these concepts, both generally and specific to PBR Painter.</p>
<h2 id="general-concepts-and-ideas">General Concepts and Ideas</h2>
<p>
The video below explains the general concepts behind layered texturing, and is a great introduction if you have no experience working with layers.

frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<h2 id="pbr-painter-layer-types-explained">PBR Painter Layer Types explained</h2>
<p> 
The specific layer types used within PBR Painter are explained in the video below. This video explains exactly how each layer works and how best to
use them for your materials.
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yScgAV66wDg" title="YouTube video player" 
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<h1 id="layer-masks">Layer Masks</h1>
<p>Layer masks are a critical component of any layer based texturing system. Masks let you choose where on the model your layers should appear, which can be achieved in
numerous ways, including using procedural effects, texture painting, image textures and much more.</p>
<p>This section of the documentation is dedicated to explaining how and why to use masks more generally, while also covering the masks that are available in PBR Painter.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-layer-masks">Introduction to Layer Masks</h2>
<p>
The video below introduces layer masks generally, and explains the masking system used in PBR Painter. With this video you should be able to understand the concepts
behind masking and also be able to implement masks into your own PBR Painter workflow.

</p>

<h2 id="pbr-painter-masks-explained">PBR Painter Masks Explained</h2>
<p> There are many different masks in PBR Painter, and therefore the video below is dedicated to explaining each of these individually. This will give you an
overview of what is available in the addon so you can use these masks more effectively in your own projects.

</p>

<h1 id="using-the-asset-browser-in-blender-3-4">Using the Asset Browser in Blender 3 &amp; 4</h1>
<p>The asset browser is a powerful tool, which was released as part of Blender 3.0. The asset browser, generally speaking,
allows you to save and reuse your Blender assets in different projects, meaning you don't have to redo the same work
over and over again, thereby saving precious time and energy.</p>
<p>The asset browser is perfectly suited to be used with PBR Painter, however the setup is not intuitive. Therefore,
the video below is dedicated to explaining the asset browser more generally and exactly how it works, while also 
explaining how to use it most effectively within PBR Painter.</p>

frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h1 id="id-maps">ID Maps</h1>
<p>ID Maps provide a valuable way to segment your model using colours. Essentially, an ID Map assigns different colours to different parts of
your model, which is then used to mask your layers in different ways.</p>
<p>The video below explains ID Maps more generally and provides a step-by-step tutorial showing how to use them in PBR Painter.</p>

frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h1 id="baking">Baking</h1>
<p>PBR Painter offers a comprehensive baking system, allowing you to take your complex, multilayer materials and turn them
into a set of textures. Below are two videos explaining the various baking features in PBR Painter, with the first covering
the basics and the second covering the more advanced features.</p>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>
This video gives an overview of PBR Painter's baking system, explaining how to take your finished material and turn it into a set of baked textures.
