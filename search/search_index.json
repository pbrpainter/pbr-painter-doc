This can be installed in Blender using the normal approach: Updating to New Versions If you already have an old version of PBR Painter installed, and wish to update to a new version, please follow the following steps: 1. Completely uninstall the old version from Blender. 2. Close and restart Blender to ensure any cached files are cleared. 3. Install the new version as per normal. Setting up the Asset Browser (Blender 3.x and 4.x Only) If you are using Blender 3, it is recommended that you choose an asset directory, within the addon preferences. This will create a new filepath to tell Blender where you're PBR Painter assets will be stored. Important Considerations (PLEASE READ) There are a few things to consider before getting started as these will have a considerable impact on your experience with PBR Painter: PBR Painter generates complex node groups associated with each layer. These are created, modified, connected and deleted using the various tools within the addon, so you never actually need to even look at the node tree. It is important to NOT delete any of the node groups created by PBR Painter as this could cause issues with the addon. Deleting nodes within a node group may break the addon entirely. There is a limit on the number of image texture nodes that can be represented using Eevee (and also for Cycles , but it is much higher). If you reach this limit by adding many PBR layers, your material will turn solid pink. If this happens, there are two potential options going forward: Option one is to hide one or more lower layers while you work on new layers. Option two is to take advantage of the Merge Visible tool (discussed more in the following sections), which will merge all of the currently visible active layers into a single layer.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started.html#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started.html#installation-and-loading-the-pbr-painter-workspace","text":"When you purchase PBR Painter, you will have access to the .zip file that contains the entire addon package.

These are essential as they put your theoretical understanding of the addon to use in real projects. These tutorials are currently separated into two separate YouTube series: Making Materials and Project-Based Tutorials . Making Materials Making Materials is dedicated to making different materials with PBR Painter, covering topics such as procedural textures, masking, decal painting and much more. Episode 1 - Procedural Rust This hands-on tutorial demonstrate how to use PBR Painter to generate amazing and tuneable procedural rust, which can be applied to your favourite metal materials. This video gives a great overview of some of the key features in PBR Painter, including masking and procedural texturing. Episode 2 - Decal Painting This video demonstrates how to take advantage of PBR Painter's amazing decal painting features. Learn how to quickly paint on your favourite decal onto a material, with complete control of the roughness, metallic, normals etc. of the decal. Episode 3 - Normal Stamps Similar to Episode 3, this video demonstrates how to use PBR Painter's decal painting process to add normal (or bump) stamps to your materials. Check it out below! Episode 4 - Peeling Paint This video is a step-by-step guide showing how to make realistic looking peeling paint masks using PBR Painter's layered masking system. Episode 5 - Photorealistic Puddles This video shows how to create photorealistic puddles within Blender using PBR Painter 2.4. Project-Based Tutorials Project-Based Tutorials are focused on texturing real 3D models, and show how to best take advantage of PBR Painter's layered texturing system to texture your models. These tutorials cover everything from masking and ID maps, through to importing textures and hand-painting imperfections and other details. These are highly recommended for beginner to intermediate PBR Painter users. Episode 1 - Viking Shield This hands-on tutorial will guide you from start to finish texturing a viking shield model. Learn a bunch of PBR Painter's most important features, such texture importing and mapping, ID maps, layer masking, decal painting and much more, while actually making an interesting and useful asset!","title":"Hands-On Tutorials"},{"location":"hands_on_tutorials.html#hands-on-tutorials","text":"In addition to the Fundamentals tutorial videos mentioned throughout this documentation, there are also a number of hands-on tutorials available.

Masks let you choose where on the model your layers should appear, which can be achieved in numerous ways, including using procedural effects, texture painting, image textures and much more. This section of the documentation is dedicated to explaining how and why to use masks more generally, while also covering the masks that are available in PBR Painter. Introduction to Layer Masks The video below introduces layer masks generally, and explains the masking system used in PBR Painter. With this video you should be able to understand the concepts behind masking and also be able to implement masks into your own PBR Painter workflow. PBR Painter Masks Explained There are many different masks in PBR Painter, and therefore the video below is dedicated to explaining each of these individually.
