Fixed bugs causing an error when attempting to add certain smart masks in Blender 4. v2.4.0: Asset browser integration UDIM support Smart masks New and improved mask UI New baking tools New pie menu Improved addon preferences New texture painting tools v2.3: Several minor bug fixes Added option to select how images are automatically saved by the addon Added option to turn on/off automatic shader compilation per material Improved performance of layer bumping Added options to change file naming convention for baked textures Added a new ID map system with multiple colors Modified material slots UI to automatically determine when to be in texture paint mode when selecting a material Moved addon outside of texture paint mode to open up access to new features Developed a dedicated workspace layout for PBR Painter Added preview option for each layer, rather than just when using procedural textures Added filled layer option, removing the need to fill every layer (painted layers as you know them will still remain!) Created a new setup for painted layers, giving easier access to the built-in painted mask via the mask stack Added option to ignore layer's masks for a given channel Replaced single channel layers with the option to paint over image textures in multichannel layers Restructured the UI to give easy access to the main channels (color, roughness, metallic etc) Added option to use another layer's mask in the current layer's mask stack Added option to use different UV maps for textures, masks etc Added option to bake textures and masks to a different UV map Added option to import a layer, or all layers, from another material Added option to import a mask, or all masks, from another material Added initial integration with 3.0 asset browser, to allow for saving and loading smart materials, layers, masks etc. (still to be improved upon in future Added option to use node group as a mask Added new icons etc. to improve the overall appearance and user-friendliness of the addon Added ambient occlusion option during baking Added options to use different edge detection methods for preset edge wear masks Added vertex color option for ID maps Added new \"View Mode\" option, accessible via the three dots button next to the layer stack. You can now select either Material (which is the standard view) or Single Channel. Added vertex color as an option for ID map, with the Fill Selected Faces feature. This will fill the selected faces with the vertex color that is selected (very useful for quickly creating ID maps for materials). Addded the option to create an Exportable Material when baking. This will setup a new material (or use a material from a dropdown menu) with the baked textures, ready to export v2.2: Improved addon performance by automatically cleaning up unused images and node groups associated with deleted layers Added option to bake and/or merge all PBR Painter materials on mesh to single texture set Revamped mask system to enable layer masks on custom layers and imported material layers Improved overall addon efficiency and performance Streamlined UI for brush settings Added extra procedural options Added buttons for preset texture resolution (1k, 2k etc) Added drop down for mapping mode (point vs texture) Added option to import a material node setup as a layer Added option to adjust color settings for albedo textures (hue/saturation and RGB curves) Streamlined access to other materials in the model's material slots Improved background layers to be more streamlined, efficient and easy to use Fixed a few minor bugs with importing materials Fixed a bug causing ID maps to sometimes not turn off correctly Added a preset \"Edge Wear\" mask Added a few new options to different parts of the UI (e.g. option to have new layer auto-filled, option to change merged mask name etc.) Added color ramp to Normal channel when using a bump map Fixed a bug causing multi-texture import to fail for \"glossiness\" textures Fixed a few bugs with baking Fixed a bug with the new box mapping rotation system (normals were being calculated globally rather than locally, which was causing the box mapped textures to change when the object was rotated) v2.1: Introduced option to instantly import and assign a set of textures automatically Introduced option to instantly link multiple channels to the layer mask automatically and simultaneously, speeding up the procedural workflow Introduced new addon preferences (autosave now in addon preferences) Moved background layer panel to more discrete button in UI Introduced additional mapping options for masks Introduced a mask multiplier for each channel, for finer control over channel masking Introduced a range of preset procedural mask options (currently scratches, grunge and cracks, more to be added), which are tunable and can be incorporated into the mask stack Improved UI by adding visual cues showing which channels are switched on/off in a layer Improved texture importing Overhauled baking system for performance improvement and a smoother user experience. Minor bug fixes relating to baking textures. Added option to use relative or absolute texture paths in PBR Painter (located under addon preferences).
