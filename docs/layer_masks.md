# Masks

Masks are a critical component of any layer based texturing system. Masks let you choose where on the model your layers should appear, which can be achieved in
numerous ways, including using procedural effects, texture painting, image textures and much more. Masks can be procedural (e.g., noise, gradients) or painted, and multiple masks can be combined for different effects. There is also a built-in (and expanding) library of *Smart Masks* which can be used to create instant complex effects, like peeling paint, rust, puddles, condensation and more.

For example:
- A procedural noise mask can create a weathered effect by applying a layer only to certain areas of the material.
- A painted mask allows you to manually define areas where a layer should be visible.

Masks can also be previewed and adjusted in real-time, making it easy to refine your material.

This section of the documentation is dedicated to explaining how and why to use masks more generally, while also covering the masks that are available in PBR Painter.

## Introduction to Layer Masks

<p>
The video below introduces layer masks generally, and explains the masking system used in PBR Painter. With this video you should be able to understand the concepts
behind masking and also be able to implement masks into your own PBR Painter workflow.
