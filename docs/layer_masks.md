# Masks

Masks are a critical component of any layer based texturing system. Masks let you choose where on the model your layers should appear, which can be achieved in
numerous ways, including using procedural effects, texture painting, image textures and much more.

This section of the documentation is dedicated to explaining how and why to use masks more generally, while also covering the masks that are available in PBR Painter.
