# Getting Started

## Installation and Loading the PBR Painter Workspace

When you purchase PBR Painter, you will have access to a .zip file that contains the entire addon package.

*************

**IMPORTANT:** If you are using Blender 4.2+, it is best to install the addon using **pbrpainter-3.2.0.zip.**

For earlier versions of Blender, you will need to use **__legacy__pbrpainter-3.2.0.zip,** otherwise it will not install.

*************

Once downloaded, open Blender, then go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons.

For Blender 4.2+, click the dropdown arrow in the top-right corner, then select *Install from Disk*:

For earlier versions of Blender, click the *Install* button directly:

## Updating to New Versions

For Blender 4.2+, simply install the new version once downloaded, in the normal way (as above).

For earlier Blender versions, if you already have an old version of PBR Painter installed and wish to update to a new version, please follow the following steps:
<p><li> 1. Completely uninstall the old version from Blender. </li>
<li> 2. Install the new version as per normal. </li>
<li> 3. Close and restart Blender to ensure any cached files are cleared. </li></p>
