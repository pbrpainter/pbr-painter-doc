# Using the Asset Browser in Blender 3 & 4

The asset browser is a powerful tool, which was released as part of Blender 3.0. The asset browser, generally speaking,
allows you to save and reuse your Blender assets in different projects, meaning you don't have to redo the same work
over and over again, thereby saving precious time and energy.

The asset browser is perfectly suited to be used with PBR Painter, however the setup is not intuitive. Therefore,
the video below is dedicated to explaining the asset browser more generally and exactly how it works, while also 
explaining how to use it most effectively within PBR Painter.
