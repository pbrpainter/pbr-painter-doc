# Changelog
_Please note that by purchasing PBR Painter you will have access to every update that is released, forever and for no extra cost._

The below shows the _major_ changes made to the addon over previous versions. Note that not all _minor_ changes are mentioned.

- __v2.4.5:__
	- Fixed a bug with autosave when no object or material is selected
	- Added option to change UV map for painted layer mask
	- Added option to adjust HSV and RGB curve for painted layers
	- Fixed several bugs with using existing nodes as background and with importing material nodes as a layer
- __v2.4.4:__

	- Fixed various bugs related to mesh maps
	- Improved how invalid filepaths are handled during baking

	- Improved performance of layer bumping
	- Added options to change file naming convention for baked textures
	- Added a new ID map system with multiple colors
	- Modified material slots UI to automatically determine when to be in texture paint mode when selecting a material
	- Moved addon outside of texture paint mode to open up access to new features
	- Developed a dedicated workspace layout for PBR Painter
	- Added preview option for each layer, rather than just when using procedural textures
	- Added filled layer option, removing the need to fill every layer (painted layers as you know them will still remain!)
	- Created a new setup for painted layers, giving easier access to the built-in painted mask via the mask stack
	- Added option to ignore layer's masks for a given channel
	- Replaced single channel layers with the option to paint over image textures in multichannel layers
	- Restructured the UI to give easy access to the main channels (color, roughness, metallic etc)
	- Added option to use another layer's mask in the current layer's mask stack
	- Added option to use different UV maps for textures, masks etc
	- Added option to bake textures and masks to a different UV map
	- Added option to import a layer, or all layers, from another material
	- Added option to import a mask, or all masks, from another material
	- Added initial integration with 3.0 asset browser, to allow for saving and loading smart materials, layers, masks etc. (still to be improved upon in future
	- Added option to use node group as a mask
	- Added new icons etc. to improve the overall appearance and user-friendliness of the addon
	- Added ambient occlusion option during baking 
	- Added options to use different edge detection methods for preset edge wear masks

	- Added new "View Mode" option, accessible via the three dots button next to the layer stack. You can now select either Material (which is the standard view) or Single Channel. 
	- Added vertex color as an option for ID map, with the Fill Selected Faces feature. This will fill the selected faces with the vertex color that is selected (very useful for quickly creating ID maps for materials).
	- Addded the option to create an Exportable Material when baking. This will setup a new material (or use a material from a dropdown menu) with the baked textures, ready to export

- __v2.2:__
	- Improved addon performance by automatically cleaning up unused images and node groups associated with deleted layers
	- Added option to bake and/or merge all PBR Painter materials on mesh to single texture set

	- Improved overall addon efficiency and performance
	- Streamlined UI for brush settings
	- Added extra procedural options
	- Added buttons for preset texture resolution (1k, 2k etc)
	- Added drop down for mapping mode (point vs texture)
	- Added option to import a material node setup as a layer 
	- Added option to adjust color settings for albedo textures (hue/saturation and RGB curves)
	- Streamlined access to other materials in the model's material slots
	- Improved background layers to be more streamlined, efficient and easy to use
	- Fixed a few minor bugs with importing materials
	- Fixed a bug causing ID maps to sometimes not turn off correctly
	- Added a preset "Edge Wear" mask
	- Added a few new options to different parts of the UI (e.g. option to have new layer auto-filled, option to change merged mask name etc.)
	- Added color ramp to Normal channel when using a bump map
	- Fixed a bug causing multi-texture import to fail for "glossiness" textures
	- Fixed a few bugs with baking
	- Fixed a bug with the new box mapping rotation system (normals were being calculated globally rather than locally, which was causing the box mapped textures to change when the object was rotated)
- __v2.1:__
	- Introduced option to instantly import and assign a set of textures automatically
	- Introduced option to instantly link multiple channels to the layer mask automatically and simultaneously, speeding up the procedural workflow

	- Moved background layer panel to more discrete button in UI
	- Introduced additional mapping options for masks
	- Introduced a mask multiplier for each channel, for finer control over channel masking

	- Brand new masking system, using layered system to build complex and highly-specific masks
	- More options for each specific mask (which can individually be added to the layered setup)
	- New displacement threshold mask, which applies a mask according to the displacement of previous layers (very cool!)
	- New option to use a custom layer, which lets you build your own layer from scratch using your own node setups, which can then be painted as a layer as per normal (important for advanced users who need highly specific node setups)
	- New copy/paste functions for procedural texture setups, for copying between channels and/or between layers
	- Improved how deleted layers are stored for improved addon performance and efficiency
	- New automated external texture saving after baking using a user-defined file directory

	- Fixed a bug that was occasionally causing an error when using a custom brush
	- Fixed a bug with the specular tint channel when using link to mask

	- Additional mask options (procedural noise, voronoi, musgrave or wave) that can be used in combination with all currently available masks
	- New autosave feature which, when turned on, automatically saves modified textures periodically, to avoid accidentally losing work
	- New duplicate layer button
	- Optional color ramp node when using a roughness, specular or metallic texture, for fine-tuning the texture (e.g. make a roughness texture more glossy)
	- Box mapping now available for imported textures, with access to a seam blend slider for creating seamless materials
	- New bake button to be used for baking the current material textures without having to use the merge visible button
	- Improved naming of baked textures to be more specific and streamlined
